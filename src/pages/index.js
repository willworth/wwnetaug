    <h1>This is all a first draft... Let's iterate together.</h1>
    <p>You've reached my site.  Welcome!  Thanks for coming.</p>
    <p>My name's Will, and I've wasted a lot of time. </p>
    <p>I'm sick of procrastinating, making excuses, and 
      feeling frustrated that I'm not making the art I want to make,
      and I've decided to just start doing it.  My hope is that by documenting
       what I'm doing, I'll be helping other people overcome their inertia or writer's block.   
    </p>
    <p>Really, you're never gonna feel ready, so you should just do it.  Good luck!</p>
    <p>“To practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it.” Kurt Vonnegut </p>
