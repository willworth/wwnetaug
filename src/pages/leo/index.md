I'm not going to write a lot here today.  I'm focused on getting this live.  Maybe I'll come back to it?

[Leo's casino](https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/5) was the last venue Otis Redding played at before dying aged just 26.


> "The club could host 700 people and regularly booked the top jazz and R&B acts of its era. The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, Ray Charles and The Temptations all performed at Leoâ€™s Casino, as did comedians Richard Pryor and Flip Wilson. Otis Redding played his final concert there on December 9, 1967, dying in a plane crash in Wisconsin the following afternoon."

Here's his [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otis_Redding).


Here's a song I wrote. I hope you like it!
